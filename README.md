# Version 1.0.0
* This is the first version of Dock. In this version I have went on with adding the most important features, that are:
## 1. Dock View
* The first screen that appears is called the Dock View, here you can see all your added Docks.

## 2. Customising Dock 
* As soon as the app opens the user can create a new Dock by clicking on the plus button provided on the right corner.

* Here you need to provide 4 properties of Dock

1. Dock Name
2. Dock Symbol
3. Dock Color
4. Dock State (Private/Open)

* The first three are compulsory and the dock state is optional, If you want you can add it later into private state.
* Once you provide all properties then press the add nutton on top right to get your dock visible on the main screen.
