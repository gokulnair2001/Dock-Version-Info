# Version 1.0.0
* This is the first version of Dock. In this version I have went on with adding the most important features, that are:

## 1. Customising Dock 
* As soon as the app opens the user can create a new Dock by clicking on the plus button provided on the right corner.
 # < Image >
* Here you need to provide 4 properties of Dock
* 1. Dock Name
* 2. Dock Symbol
* 3. Dock Color
* 4. Dock State (Private/Open)
* The first three are compulsory and the dock state is optional, If you want you can add it later into private state.
* Once you provide all properties then press the add nutton on top right to get your dock visible on the main screen.
