# Version 1.0.0
* This is the first version of Dock. In this version I have went on with adding the most important features, that are:
## 1. Dock View
* The first screen that appears is called the Dock View, here you can see all your added Docks.

## 2. Customising Dock 
* As soon as the app opens the user can create a new Dock by clicking on the plus button provided on the right corner.

* Here you need to provide 4 properties of Dock

1. Dock Name
2. Dock Symbol
3. Dock Color
4. Dock State (Private/Open)

* The first three are compulsory and the dock state is optional, If you want you can add it later into private state.
* Once you provide all properties then press the add nutton on top right to get your dock visible on the main screen.

## 3. Dock Property Customisation

* So once the user clicks on any dock , they will get into Dock item section. Here the user can add items for his dock. For adding any item user need to click on the top right button, which will provide a form to add dock items.

* Once the user clicks it they will get into a Item form where they need to add certain formalities, like title, body, reminder time and etc.
* In order to make users work easy I have provided various Dock tools which will help them to add item body very easily and that to hassle free.
* The tools are:
1. OCR Support for image
2. OCR suport for scanning documents
3. Voice Recogniton

* User can use any of these feature to add the body of item.
