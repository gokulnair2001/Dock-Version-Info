# Version 1.0.0
* This is the first version of Dock. In this version I have went on with adding the most important features. All the important and key features of app are mentioned below, do have a look.

## 1. Dock View
* The first screen that appears is called the Dock View, here you can see all your added Docks.

### What is Dock ?

* Dock is basically a categorised set of file/document which consists of all your added items. 
* Every Dock is unique and you can't create Dock of same name since the name of Dock is an unique propert!
* Various characteristics of Dock are mentioned below:

## 2. Customising Dock 
* As soon as the app opens the user can create a new Dock by clicking on the plus button provided on the right corner.

* Here you need to provide 4 properties of Dock

1. Dock Name
2. Dock Symbol
3. Dock Color
4. Dock State (Private/Open)

* The first three are compulsory and the dock state is optional, If you want you can add it later into private state.
* Once you provide all properties then press the add button on top right to get your dock visible on the main screen.

## 3. Dock Property Customisation
* So there are times when you need to make a Dock Delete/Privatise/Open it. So dont worry, By doing long press on any dock you will get 3 properties called
1. Open
2. Privatise
3. Delete Dock

## 4. Adding Dock items

* The tools are:

2. OCR suport for scanning documents
3. Voice Recogniton

* User can use any of these feature to add the body of item.
